= Clock

== Open

== Closed

* [x] fix the display of "check the time", it is too narrow and tall.
* [x] fix hitbox

	i replaced the hacky method of the choices and removal of choices.

* [x] make it more obvious that you need to click the clock at the end of the period.

	replaced the sleeping text to "Wait" and not "Rest", and also made it blink so it draws the mouse easier.
