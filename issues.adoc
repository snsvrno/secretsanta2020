= Issues

== General

- [x] the dialogue has weird width correction, looks bad.
- [x] it looks like some text formatting isn't working?
- [x] dialogue choice wheel should change diameter based on choice options.
-- kind of fixed this one, now a stack instead of a wheel.
- [ ] the ui is drawn over the text in some cases (inventory and dialogue)

== Scene

- [ ] i made a better way to remove the wheel with the sun / clock item. refactor the scene's version of that (the fake interactive) with this way instead.

== Menu / UI

- [ ] mouse over buttons don't expand from the vertical middle as expected.
