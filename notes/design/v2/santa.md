#  Secret Santa Notes

## Story

### Framing Story

The player is unconscious in an escape pod and currently in cryosleep. The player has been experiencing fragments and pieces of their memories being played back to them. The player will not see this unless they unlock certain items / endings in the game. This could be considered the true ending.

### Dream World

The player is travelling the country side and has wound up in a new city on the way. They decide to spend the day there and explore before heading out. Everyday they wake up on the bus and leave the bus. Everynight they make their way back to the bus and head to the next stop. Because of the weird mechanics of the dream world they wind up replaying the same day everytime in an endless cycle.

#### Timespans

There are **3** major times:

- Morning
- Afternoon
- Evening

With **2** modifiers:

- Early
- Late

Making **6** total times that can be travelled.

#### Locations

- coffee shop / internet café 
- market / grocery
- beach
- park
- town square
- school
- business park
- garage

#### the True Ending

You throw a message in a bottle to sea. It comes back the next cycle and it has a cryptic message, and then your player snaps awake in the real world. You were unconscious for some reason and everyone is looking around you worried. They are the people you were dreaming about.

There might be a "wizard of oz" moment where its like "I had the strangest dream, you were in it! and you!"

#### Main Characters

Main characters will move around and have complex dialogue that will drive quests and item development.

###### :flags: ​Car Trouble

The quest that fits most with their personality, they want to be able to leave this town. At the end of this quest they will have the option to finally leave and continue this journey. Or they could possible choose to stay and see what happens.

You talk to **One** and they mention that they are having lots of issues with their car, and need to get it fixed before they can leave. You go to the mechanic and talk to them about it. 

Talking to **One** will issue the quest, but you can do the stuff before talking to her because you might not have time in one playthrough to do it all.

They wants to go on a bike ride but their bike has a flat tire and hasn't fixed it yet. If the player gives them a spare tire they can go home and repair it. If they do that he goes on a nice ride through the country and comes back with a bottle of wine.

The timeline will be the same as in **General**. The player must give the person a spare tire before they go to class in order to trigger this. When you give them the tire they disappear from the board.

| Early Morning              | Late Morning              | Early Afternoon                  | Late Afternoon                                               | Early Evening                                                | Late Evening                 |

(player needs to give the tire by ***Late Morning***). If **Three** is only gone for 1 period then they will comment that they didn't get too far, and could have done more if they had more time. |                              |

###### :flags: a Short Hike

The teacher wants to go on an all night backpacking trip. It would be a beautiful night to be out there and watch the stars. They can't because they have a class they need to teach and they can't just hand it over to the TA because they need to prepare the lecture. You need to get to the teaching assistant and give them the notes from the previous cycle in order for **Three** to be comfortable leaving it with them.

This one is confusing, because in order to do this you have to attend the lecture at the school and then take notes, you can give those notes to the TA and they will then be able to give the lecture.

##  Mechanics

### UI Elements

There are the following things that need to be visible an tracked throughout the game.

- Time of Date / Scene Sequence
- Backpack of items
- Main menu access / menu
- End the current scene.
- A journal - records things as you find them, and tracks the different endings you've achieved.
  - explains everything, and how you got it in the past. helps it not get to overly confusing.

### Overmap / Main Map

The only screen will be the main game map, this will be like a board game board that shows all the locations the player can travel to.

#### Pieces / Map Markers

It will show a marker for the player and a mark for all the NPCs that the player knows about. For example, the first time you play there won't be any markers down, but if you encounter a certain NPC at a certain time and place then they will be shown on the map all subsequent playthroughs.

### Scenes

There is only one real viewport for the entire game, the map screen, which kind of looks like a game board. When you click on locations it will then fade out the map a little and place props on top. This was there will not be a dedicated backdrop for everything, instead just enough to describe the scene.
