= Design by Items

This file intends to design the game by choosing what the items will be, and then work backwards to characters, locations, and endings.

- want no more than 6 items to work with, anything more will be too much.
- want all characters to use all items
- shooting for 4 characters. too many characters will be too much complexity.
- 1 character must by a cyclist or rollerblader.
