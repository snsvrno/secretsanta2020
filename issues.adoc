= Issues

== Clock

- [ ] the dialogue has weird width correction, looks bad.
- [ ] it looks like some text formatting isn't working?

== scene

- [ ] i made a better way to remove the wheel with the sun / clock item. refactor the scene's version of that (the fake interactive) with this way instead.

== Menu / UI

- [ ] mouse over buttons don't expand from the vertical middle as expected.
