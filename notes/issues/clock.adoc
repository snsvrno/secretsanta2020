= Clock

== Open

* [ ] remove the interactives on the clock, replace with permanent buttons

	make it always display what time of day it is on top of the clock, and make a more obvious button that tells the player that they can go to the next period.

== Closed

* [x] fix the display of "check the time", it is too narrow and tall.
* [x] fix hitbox

	i replaced the hacky method of the choices and removal of choices.

* [x] make it more obvious that you need to click the clock at the end of the period.

	replaced the sleeping text to "Wait" and not "Rest", and also made it blink so it draws the mouse easier.
