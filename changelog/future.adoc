= 1.3.0

Update focusing on UX and player experience. Goal is to make the main loop more obvious as project the intent to the player better.

== General

* adds the ability to change your name without having to clear the data.

== Clock

* moves the period text over the clock so its more obvious when people mention it.
* also shows how many slots (locations) left in the period on the screen at all times.
* now emphasises that you should press the clock when there are no more slots (blinking and glow).

== Conversations

* changed from "right click" to close a conversation to moving away from the dialogue choices

	i wanted it to be obvious how to leave a conversation and when it is happening, so if you physcially move the move the mouse away it will fade the conversation until you leave.

* adds symbol that shows there is more conversation next in the dialogue.
