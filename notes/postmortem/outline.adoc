== Some Notes While Making It

* I wish i thought about having to test the dialogue when building the systems, to allow for easier testing or fast forwarding of dialogue.
* Wish I had better debug tools.
* Have the dialogue tree automatically make switches for conversation ids, so i don't have to make them manually.
* Would like a better dialogue editor. Hide became unresponsive fast.
* would be nice to have a way to comment switches and values so i can remember their purpose.

== Questions I have.

* how do layers work?
