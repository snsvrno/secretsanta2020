= Backpack

issues related to the backpack mechanic.

== Open

* [ ] animate the backpack to appear smoother
* [ ] the hitbox on the mouseout make the backpack appear jittery.

	the first time you open the backpack you accidently close it because you move the mouse outside of the area, this feels bad.

== Completed

* [x] fix the background drawing for the backpack icon, it "forgets" to draw the background sometimes.
* [x] select final background color
* [x] change the font for the title / description to fit better.
