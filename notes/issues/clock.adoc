= Clock

== Open

* [ ] fix hitbox

	i made a better way to remove the wheel with the sun / clock item. refactor the scene's version of that (the fake interactive) with this way instead.

* [ ] make it more obvious that you need to click the clock at the end of the period.

	its not apparently clear when you can't go to any other locations that you must press the clock in order to progress

* [ ] remove the interactives on the clock, replace with permanent buttons

	make it always display what time of day it is on top of the clock, and make a more obvious button that tells the player that they can go to the next period.

== Closed

* [x] fix the display of "check the time", it is too narrow and tall.
